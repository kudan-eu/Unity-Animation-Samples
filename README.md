# Unity Animation Samples
Unity Animation Samples using KudanAR

In order for this sample project to work, you will need to download the KudanAR Unity plugin from the [Kudan website](https://www.kudan.eu/download/). Import the plugin into the project, open one of the "Animation" scenes and you should be good to go!

If you have any feedback about our SDK or provided sample source code, please get in touch with us at [our support site](https://www.kudan.eu/support/).

Thanks!
